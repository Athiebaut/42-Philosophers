Philosophers

Philosophers is a concurrency-focused project that introduces the fundamental challenges of multithreaded programming.
The project is built around a classic synchronization problem and aims to develop a strong understanding of how multiple execution flows interact while sharing limited resources.

Through this project, we explore thread lifecycle management, synchronization primitives, and the difficulties inherent to concurrent systems, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation. Philosophers emphasizes reasoning about timing, ordering, and resource access in an environment where operations happen simultaneously and unpredictably.

Philosophers serves as a key milestone toward understanding parallelism and concurrency, skills that are critical in modern software development, from system programming to high-performance and distributed applications.
